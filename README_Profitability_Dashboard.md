# 📊 Profitability & Financial Health Analysis – Service Business Case Study

This project presents a detailed financial analysis of a service-based company using a combination of Python (Jupyter Notebook) for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive visual reporting. The aim is to uncover insights related to revenue, profitability, and expense patterns across departments and months.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the financial health of a service company by exploring and reporting on:

- Revenue growth over time  
- Net profit trends and margin performance  
- Departmental and monthly cost structures  
- Expense category distributions  
- Key profitability drivers

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Jupyter Notebook

EDA was performed in Python using the following steps:

- Imported and previewed the Excel dataset  
- Cleaned and formatted monetary columns  
- Created calculated metrics (e.g., Net Profit Margin)  
- Applied financial formatting for clarity  
- Exported clean and transformed data for use in Power BI

## 📊 Power BI Visualization

The Power BI dashboard complements the EDA by providing a highly visual breakdown of:

- Monthly Revenue vs Net Profit trends  
- Expense breakdown by category and department  
- Profit margin cards and trend visuals  
- Dynamic slicers for Department and Month filters
